            <p>My name is Blake Demelo-Anderson, however, I prefer Blake Demelo. I was born in NSW Australia with Portuguese family. However, English is my primary language.
            With my European heritage I have grown up to love soccer, I have always played and there’s nothing I love more than watching the game with my friends and family.</p>
            <p>I completed a cert 3 in IT during my HSC in 2019, followed by a cert 4 in Networking and IT the following year. The past two years I have focused on industry certificates with Microsoft, such as the MSCA Server 2016 exam.</p>

            <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
          </div>

          <div class"sectionContent">
            <p>As Information Technology (IT) covers a vast number of activities, tools, and equipment, my interest in IT was not initiated due to an individual aspect. However, as most young people gaming was an integral part of growing up which paved the path for becoming more hands on with computers and wanting to understand more. This led to building computers and exposure to the problem-solving aspect of IT, it was satisfying once creating a problem and resolving the problem. The general integrity of IT continued to dominate my life once studying became important to me and the efficiencies and tools IT brought were undeniably reliable, such as cloud services and the flexibility of having all of your sources and tools within one device. An example, I began my schooling experience with six separate workbooks and textbooks. Once I finished school, I had one laptop with the equivalent if not more tools accessible.
            The ability to increase efficiency was the bedrock to what sparked my interest in IT, however, I grew up in a home environment which this was possible.</p>
            <p>I chose to come to RMIT as the university has a high level of recognition for Information Technology with good reputation. This is also true within my businesses with multiple employees studying or completed studying through RMIT.
            It is equally important that RMIT provides flexible studying conditions as well extremely accessible tools through canvas. Such as recordings of webinars and other online tools. The online accessibility is ultimately what makes the experience. A course dedicated and created solely to be studied online means all of the content and tools are purposely available.</p>
            <p>Learning elements of IT is the foundation of the course however, specifically building a rich vocabulary within the industry is important to me as this won’t just aid my IT ability, but it will strengthen other aspects such as planning projects and designing projects in a team environment. Building from this, cyber security is a field which I am exposed to on a regular basis, I expect to understand more of the fundamental ideas of this topic. Finally, coming from a background with no programming, I also expect to have a great level of knowledge within programming with python as well developing websites and applications.</p>

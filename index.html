                <p>My name is Blake Demelo-Anderson, however, I prefer Blake Demelo. I was born in NSW Australia with Portuguese family. However, English is my primary language.
                With my European heritage I have grown up to love soccer, I have always played and there’s nothing I love more than watching the game with my friends and family.</p>
                <p>I currently work with an ICT company contracted to Defence, it is an amazing environment, I love the variety of work and hope to stay in the field for many more years. I completed a cert 3 in IT during my HSC in 2019, followed by a cert 4 in Networking and IT. The past two years I have focused on industry certificates with Microsoft, such as the MSCA Server 2016 exam.</p>

             <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionContent">

             <p>As Information Technology (IT) covers a vast number of activities, tools, and equipment, my interest in IT was not initiated due to one individual aspect. However, similar to most young people, gaming was an integral part of growing up. This paved the path for becoming more hands on with computers and wanting to understand more. This led to building computers and exposure to the problem-solving aspect of IT, it was satisfying to create a problem and then resolve the problem. The general integrity of IT continued to dominate my life once studying gained importance in my life and the efficiencies and tools IT brought were undeniably reliable, such as cloud services and the flexibility of having all your sources and tools within one device. For example, I began my schooling experience with six separate workbooks and textbooks. Once I finished school, I had one laptop with the equivalent of these tools as well as other relevant accessible tools.
             The ability to increase efficiency was the bedrock to what sparked my interest in IT, and gratefully, I grew up in a home environment which this was possible.</p>
             <p>I chose to attend RMIT as the university has a high level of recognition and a good reputation for Information Technology. There was also a large influence within my businesses with multiple employees studying or completed studying through RMIT.
             It is equally important that RMIT provides flexible studying conditions as well extremely accessible tools through canvas. Such as recordings of webinars and other online tools. The online accessibility is ultimately what makes the experience beneficial. A course dedicated and created solely to be studied online means all of the content and tools are purposely available.</p>
             <p>Learning elements of IT is the foundation of the course however, specifically building a rich vocabulary within the industry is important to me, as this won’t just aid my IT ability, but it will strengthen other aspects such as; planning projects and designing projects in a team environment. Building from this, cyber security is a field which I am exposed to on a regular basis, I expect to understand more of the fundamental ideas of this topic. Finally, coming from a background with no programming, I also expect to have a great level of knowledge within programming with python as well developing websites and applications.</p>

               <h2>Jacobs Security Systems Engineer - Defence</h2>
             </div>
            <div class="sectionContent">

            <div class="sectionTitle">
              <h2>Why is This Role Appealing</h2>
            </div>
                <p>The position provides an opportunity which is related to IT and security that requires problem solving within environments that may need security consultation, or for existing projects and systems that are being developed or supported. Importantly, it covers most aspects of an IT project; creating, developing, identifying and resolving issues, supporting existing systems, managing teams, working with customers, and conducting assessments. Combining these points creates an environment which is hands on and requires an expert level of knowledge within the security world, but not generally specialising in one field which is my goal. These reasons make this role appealing for myself. Further to these points, the Defence IT environment is a place that is always innovating and expanding the boundaries of security which I have become comfortable with and a space I hope to continue working in.</p>
                <p>This role requires an experienced technical ability to work with products, services and to consult project ideas and designs, within the IT space as well as the Defence world. The technical ability to work with these points include understanding the end user’s environment, such as the specifications of a unit to identify hardware vulnerabilities. Comprehension of the end user’s system and software and how it operates in the background, potentially required when conducting a security risk assessment and when identifying system security vulnerabilities.
                Expanding from the technical ability, the ability to communicate and justify findings and conclusions is required for this role as it involves multiple parties, such as end users, stakeholders and internal team members. Particularly when working with team members creating and working on plans and processes will be required which will require accurate and stable communication skills.
                Outside of working with a deployed product, identifying vulnerabilities internally will also be required, such as risk compliances within the organisation, which include documentation and other security processes.
                Following on from this, experience within the Defence environment is required as Defence systems and processes have specific regulations and security guidelines which is essential to understand when working on Defence systems.</p>

              <h2>Personal Key Skills</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="keySkills">

                <li>- Project Management
                <li>- Organisation
                <li>- Industry Awareness
                <li>- Motivation
                <li>- Problem Solving
                <li>- Affective Communication
                <li>- Team player
                <li>- Adaptable
                <li>- Self Sufficient
            </div>

                <p>The skills I have obtained were acquired from both my qualifications and experience.
                One of the skills acquired include the ability to problem solve within environments that require a general technical level of knowledge. Such as, working on system faults and findings. This may include fixing a problem within an isolated system such as; an application won’t open on a user’s account or, on a larger scale, a network server won’t communicate to a print server. The ability to problem solve is additionally utilized when developing project ideas in a team environment that includes meeting customers’ needs and realistic outcomes.
                Additionally to problem solving, I have acquired a skill for communication. Having the ability to navigate conversations with end users in heated scenarios and verbalise in a non-technical manner when required. An example would be as follows, resolving an end user’s problem and explaining the solution in an understandable manner. Communicating affectively is also a skill I have used when in an internal workplace, specifically when working in a large group or team on a project, which involves many ideas that are required to be detailed appropriately to ensure all members understand the information I have provided.
                These skills were slowly developed during my last three years of experience in the IT and Defence world. My first year I developed my communication skills while working on a help desk as a help desk technician. The help desk experience exposed me to a large variety of IT environments, such as; servers, databases, network setups and end user configuration within Microsoft Azure and local setups. Additionally to this, I was able to begin basic trouble shooting on customers systems. The following two years involved moving to a Defence environment which was more hands on with servers and deployed systems. However, these two years also provided exposure to project management and assessments of deployed environments. The assessments developed may include the vulnerability of a system or what improvements are required to ensure the organisation is meeting the end users requirements while still adhering to the Defence regulations. These two years have allowed me to become a sponge and absorb all of information and processes that are common within the ICT space, as well as Defence.
                Building on these skills and improving was possible via the qualifications I have been able to accumulate. These qualifications include: MSCA Windows Server 2016, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, and Certificate 4 in Networking and Information Technology.</p>
                <p>Three steps to acquiring the outlined projected job include obtaining and developing IT skills, gaining further and advanced qualifications and continuing to grow experience during this time.
                Exposure to the industry and other professionals will allow for my skills to develop. Skills such as identifying issues, understanding vulnerabilities within environments, and the ability to manage groups and teams. Being exposed to a vast number of professionals provides an opportunity to observe and learn different methods. While continuing to work with these tools I have will increase my general skill set.
                While gaining qualifications I will be able to develop a more technical skill set, this may include programming, security assessment and networking capabilities. This will be possible through studying this bachelor of IT and can be further developed via industry certifications.
                To accomplish obtaining the general and technical skills required, the experience with the tools and processes are most important. This will be accomplished via combining what I have learnt through working with other professionals and what I have studied and applying what has been learnt to the work force.</p>

                </div>
                  <h2>What do the above tests mean to me</h2>
                  <p>The test results mean I can visually see personality traits weighed against each other. The benefit of this is perspective, being more aware of what common traits I might have in each scenario. Although these results do not dictate my actions, I am able to reflect on the results and be more aware. An example, many of my results lean towards acting intuitive and assertive over being more observant and cautious. Although each of these traits have pros and cons, being aware that I have resulted dominantly in acting in a direct manner means I may pay more attention to my actions and use the appropriate traits when needed.
                  However, these results were constructed from answers in which I provided, answers which could have been different on another day. Therefore, I would not live by the outcomes of these tests.</P>
                  <p>These test results do not limit the extension of myself reflection or my perspective on others, however, they allow room for consideration. Further on from this point, the test results mean I can consider how I react or treat someone else in a team scenario in which a colleague may share vastly different results to myself. An example, if someone had results which demonstrated reflector style personality traits and we were working on a project together, I can reflect on my
                  personal results and understand that I might prefer a direct and logical approach to an idea but to ensure the efficiency of the team I may consider taking a slower approach to an idea and gathering more data and having deeper discussions on the matter. However, I will not be limited to this approach.</P>
                  <p>If I was to form a team, and the results of members were available I would consider the variety of different results to potentially create a more supportive and effective environment. Rather than having a team which resulted heavily in assertiveness and extraverted, or observant and introverted. A more balanced team could be created to ensure all roles were comfortably appointed. However, I would not limit my decision making solely on the results of these tests as these results may not be a true reflection of who we really are.</P>

                <h1>Project Idea - Payment Tracker</h1>
              </div>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>When going on holiday with friends/family, going out to eat or attending an event it can typically become difficult to track all the payments made, specifically when someone has loaned money. My project idea is to create an application which tracks when you owe ‘x’ money and when ‘x’ owes you money. Rather than going on holiday and having to constantly transfer money to multiple recipients the group can track all transactions and pay in which manner suits them best.</p>
                <h2> Motivation</h2>
                  <p>The motivation for this project idea came from work colleagues and friends. When working with colleagues and going away/out with friends we often purchase items such as coffee, lunch, dinner, entertainment and snacks for each other daily, by doing this we are having to constantly transfer funds on a daily basis. Transferring funds as often as this, floods your transaction list with little payments. Therefore, the need for an app, which simply lists how much each party member has loaned to ‘x’.</p>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>When budgeting and keeping track of payments these little payments can add up unnoticeably and are difficult to track. This app allows you to keep track of how much money each member borrowed or has loaned out. This way the party in which owes money can pay in the manner that is most suitable to them. Or can track how much they have been loaning out. As an example, you are going away with friends on a holiday. A title can be created ‘Spain Holiday 2022’ and a new group inside for each member of the holiday. Within each member details on how much they owe and how much they are owed is listed. This is also detailed so they know who owes them money and who they owe money.<p>
                <div class="list:">
                    <li> Michael
                    <li> Joe
                    <li> Sarah
                    <li> Tahliah
                </div>
                  <p>The holiday has ended and now Joe can pay Sarah the $300 he owes her from the multiple times in which Sarah loaned Joe money, rather than having to pay the $300 throughout the holiday. One simple transaction can be made described as ‘Spain Holiday 2022’. This avoids any scenario which may include the times both parties forgot Sarah loaned money to Joe and avoid the simple little transactions, each time having to enter a description of the payment.
                  Using the scenario provided earlier with the work colleagues and friends, you see these people daily and lend money when paying for lunch or dinner. Rather than requesting your work colleague or friend to transfer money on the occasion, you can document it and pay at a later date. An example, if your work colleague goes out to buy you lunch often it is easier to document it and pay them in bulk rather than pay them $15 everyday.
                  As version 2 of the application and later, other features are to be added such as paying the member through the app. Rather than having to enter the app to determine how much it is required to pay and proceeding by having to open your bank app and manually type the amount. Other version 2 or later features include setting day limits to which you must pay the recipient, an example if Sarah and Joe worked together and they frequently purchased each other lunch and drinks, Sarah can request to have the loaned money paid within 30 days. As well as adding a system to calculate how much money you have borrowed from said ‘user’ and how much you have loaned out.
                  The application will be accessible via IOS, MacOS, Android and Windows.<p>
                <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
                  <p>Software for development:
                  ReactNative will be used to develop the application, as it provides capability to be accessible on all platforms required.
                  Database:
                  As data will need to be stored from the users input and users will need to be distinguished a noSQL database will be used, specifically Firebase as this database will work smoothly with ReactNative. Further benefit to using Firebase, it acts in real-time therefore all updates made by users will be uploaded to all other users In real-time.
                  Servers:
                  As we are developing the app with Firebase a cloud service, we will not require any servers.</p>
                <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <div class="list:">
                  <li> Programming ability with Java (required for React Native).
                  <li> Understanding of cloud infrastructure in order to work with Firebase.
                  <li> Ability to simultaneously translate between programming for each operating system.
                  <li> Ability to maintain and design databases to ensure a smooth and well performing app.
                </div>
                  <p>These skills can be obtained through researching the software and understanding what you need specifically with each component as your needs with React Native and Firebase will be different to other users, although the further versions of the application will begin to require a more expert level of knowledge. This is also true for the programming aspect however, the ability to program an application with the flexibility that is required will not be an easy skill to fine.<p>
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                  <p>If the project Is successful an application will be developed in which allows users to have a simple way of monitoring and tracking borrowed money by friends and family on holidays, work occasions or simply going out on the weekend. The initial problem of cluttered transactions due to constantly transferring peers’ money will be solved by now having a platform which you can keep track of these transactions with friends and pay borrowed money back at a later date. The impact of the development will mean friends and family can go on holiday or go out for lunch and enjoy their time without worrying about constantly transferring money for a small drink or meal every time.</p>
